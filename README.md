# ❤️ Amita AI Assistant - The Virtual Crush

> *"When she didn't reply to my texts, I wrote code to make her talk."*

**Amita AI** is a unique Virtual Assistant project built with Python and AI. Unlike standard robotic assistants, Amita has a personality. She acts like a childhood friend/crush, speaks in **Hinglish** (Hindi + English), expresses emotions (sighs, laughs), and uses a hybrid visual system that switches between an "Idle" state and a "Talking" video loop to feel alive.
